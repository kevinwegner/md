modui B E T A
======
![Demo](http://i.pi.gy/w4JZo.png)
======

rewriting [modui](https://github.com/obble/modui "mod ui") from the ground up in the back-end, it still kind of looks the same. a cleaner, more modern take on the classic warcraft ui you want to play with.

   many features you love from modui are currently missing or unfinished in this development version of the ui, it exists publically for the purposes of testing, feedback, and documentation!
   dont delete your old versions just yet...

   options can currently be toggled on or off in [vars/var.lua](https://github.com/obble/md/tree/master/var/var.lua)

## TODO
* enemy castbars
* unit  frames
* group frames
* options window
* cookie cutter talent guides
* short boss descriptions?
* other stuff
* ...
